# Configure which channels to listen to. This must be either the string "all",
# to subscribe to all the available LCM channels, or a list of the channels to
# subscribe to. The list should contain dictionaries with two keys: "channel",
# with the channel name, and "type", with the type name. For example:
#   subs:
#     - channel: "LIDAR"
#       type: "lidar_t"
#     - channel: "SLAM_POSE"
#       type: "pose2D_t"
# The "type" can be any type that can be imported by the bridge, written in the
# form "my_custom_pkg.my_type_t". If no module is specified, the bridge will
# attempt to load the type from the package "mbot_lcm_msgs".
subs: "all"
# A list of strings with channel names to ignore.
ignore_channels: []
# A list of strings with the names of Python packages to search for LCM types.
# The bridge will look here to try to determine the type of a message if it was
# not provided. These must be importable by the bridge.
lcm_type_modules:
  - mbot_lcm_msgs
# The map channel, for efficiency considerations.
map_channel: SLAM_MAP
